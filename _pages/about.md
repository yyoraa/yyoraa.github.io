<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Yiyun Deng. I graduated from SHS(Shanghai High School) and am currently a 3rd year undergraduate at THU(Tsinghua University), majoring in Mathematics and Physics.
At present, I am doing LLM research in HKUST NLP and very fortunate to be advised by Professor Junxian He. I'm much interested in reasoning and agents. I also pay close attention to LLM4Finance and LLM4Games.
